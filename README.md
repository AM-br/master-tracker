# Welcome!

**For anyone joining this document for the first time from** [**thetheoristgateway.com**](http://thetheoristgateway.com)**, welcome!**

The [Official Game Theorists Discord](https://discord.gg/Vvp2u2r) has many ARG channels where you can solve clues with the community and also find teams for the ARG! Please make sure to follow all rules if you join!

This repository serves as a master tracker of strategies tried and progress and is the spiritual successor to the original Master Tracker used for the Fortnite ARG. All time stamps are MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM \(24-hour\) in Eastern Standard Time UTC-5 \(previously Eastern Daylight Time UTC-4\). To convert the time from EDT/EST into your timezone, use [this tool](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html).

### Website Outline

This doc is divided **by gate**, with four subsections for each gate.

* _**Open leads**_ are **unsolved** leads that are **actively** being investigated.
* _**Cold leads**_ are **stale** leads that have only lead to dead ends, and may not be a part of the ARG.

  Probably don't bother, 99% will be a waste of time.

* _**Closed leads**_ are **solved** leads that **should not be repeated** as that would be a waste of time.

  Solved gates are also marked as **"archived"**, which should be treated the same.

* _**Hoaxes**_ are confirmed to either be fake or unrelated.

**Leads are divided into their origins**, which give the lead a zero-indexed **ID number**, which is also used for that lead's URL/filename. For example, **D.Y1** for a Digital/YouTube lead. ID numbers are prefixed with their gate if being referenced from another gate, so as not to confuse two D.Y0's, etc.

* **Digital** \(D\): originating from the internet
  * **YouTube** \(Y\): originating from YouTube \(channels, assets, videos\)
  * **Gateway** \(G\): originating from thetheoristgateway.com or a clearly affiliated site
  * **External** \(E\): originating from external websites
* **Real-World** \(R\): originating from the physical world
  * **Merch** \(M\): originating from merch
* **Keys** \(K\): labeled keys from gates

And finally, a word of wisdom:

> please remember to pay attention to all details before trying to jump into finding a solution. this is why we keep going in circles, everyone is rushing to find a solution and all they did was repeat a fraction of the work done months ago.
>
> and please don't bring too much personal connection to your theories..
>
> people have tried to prove that the cube turns out to be a giant Leviathan skin because they believed every leak they saw and they were only looking for evidence to prove that and ended up missing info because of it
