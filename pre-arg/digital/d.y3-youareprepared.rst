D.Y3: ◉youareprepared◉
======================

On 09/29, at the date and time listed in `D.E0 <d.e0-theorist-gateway.md>`_\ , a new `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPyz8IJTgqE&feature=push-u-sub&attr_tag=Uoe19UEmVT2twHW1%3A6>`_ was uploaded to the tenretni olleh channel (\ `D.Y1 <d.y1-tenretni-olleh.md>`_\ ). It consisted of a distorted Game Theory intro, followed by a message in English (“Hello Internet. Are you ready to take the first step? Good. Great. So are we.”), followed by a ciphertext message.

The opening features glitched hexadecimal text on the bottom of the screen at (0:06 and 0:08). The first hex text is ``6a 75 6c 79 20 31 35 20 31 39 38 33`` which decodes to ``july 15 1983``. The second hex text is ``74 68 65 20 66 69 72 73 74 20 31`` which decodes to ``the first 1``. 07/15/1983 was the release date of the Nintendo Famicom in Japan, the "first" Nintendo game system.

The distorted Game Theory intro also features a binary code (at 0:13) on the bricks as Mario runs across the screen. Using a key (at 0:14) saying that red is one and black is zero, it decodes to `https://www.thetheoristgateway.com/notthefirst18fc17.html <https://www.thetheoristgateway.com/notthefirst18fc17.html>`_.

This lead is further explored in (\ `D.E1 <d.e1-notthefirst.md>`_\ ).

The five English sentences are written in different colours: green, blue, yellow, purple (fade to green), and green.

The final ciphertext message has been decoded as a simple substitution cipher. The text reads\ ``FIND THE SEARCH - READ THE NOTES - FEAR RABBITS THAT VENTURE INTO HOLES - THE GATES SHALL SUMMON YOU - PATIENCE - AND KNOW THIS - YOUAREPREPARED``\ The "search" probably refers to the word search (\ `D.E1 <d.e1-notthefirst.md>`_\ ) and the notes to the notebook (\ `D.E2 <d.e2-leave-luck-to-heaven.md>`_\ ). Gates are also referred to in the notebook, and rabbit holes are a common ARG term.

For recording purposes, at the beginning of the intro, when the symbols on the logo flash, they repeat a lot. The sequence is as follows (A = all, TL = top left, etc.): TL, BL, BR, TR, A, BR, TR, A, TL, BL, A, A, A, A.

A spectrogram of the video has revealed a key for the cipher with a full alphabet and numeric system. The spectrogram shows the alphabet, two dots, then the numbers 0-9, then another two dots, then mathematical equations which can be used to deduce the meanings of operators. This cipher is later used in `D.E1 <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ODR4aT7x6KT9xr-D9lMoXox9_3Xt86UINMvnhyQJh9o/edit#heading=h.8wa777rdywjp>`_.

The spectrogram also shows text "the one replaced", which probably indicates how to decipher `D.E1 <d.e1-notthefirst.md>`_.
