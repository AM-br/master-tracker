D.Y4: The END of Princess Peach
===============================

In the Game Theory video posted on 10/06 at around 16:00, the intro from `D.Y3 <d.y3-youareprepared.md>`_ was substituted in place of the standard intro. This is most likely used as a catch up for players who have not yet seen the video on the tenretni olleh channel.

A cipher was hidden in a book at 05:07. The book had a picture of Princess Peach in an 8-bit style with the text "GWNWWGRC WHFE ZW MCHLEZY SDTBBPW WT" above it. The cipher was decoded as a Vigenère with the key "TOADSTOOL\ **"**. The plaintext "NINTENDO LORE WE TOTALLY PLANNED IT" appears to be in reference to the Nintendo theme that has prevailed across the ARG thus far.
