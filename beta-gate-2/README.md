# Beta Gate 2

BETA GATE 2 opened at 8:00PM PST on 12/28. Originally, it was planned to open on 12/24 at 2:00PM PST, but CreatorINK changed it because of the holidays. The flashing gate provided morse which translated into "weareseven". BG2 had 3 keys, each one different from another with the same "Game Theory" revolving theme. The biggest hint theorists got before this gate was that they would need the special cypher translator or a similar tool. This was found to be useful on Key 3 (answer and details in the keys page) and affected the time the most.

After finishing the gate, theorists found the "final clue" was another message from CreatorINK that stated "you DO NOT want to miss the next one. Because it's going to be..." and then glyphs. These glpyhs were translated so that it showed the word "SPECIAL"
