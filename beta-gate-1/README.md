# Beta Gate 1

Beta Gate 1 opened on 12/20 at 8:00PM PST. The blinking morse code on the gate translated to "BREAKME". Thetheoristgateway had been updated to provide another page for the BETA GATES, which included 3 gates, logos for each gate, and a seperate leaderboard. It was announced that the top 77 finishers (for BG1) would get free merch (providing they payed the shipping fee) and the top 10 would get $50 dollars each! This gate had a central theme around the ARG in general, with no subtheme for each key.

Later on, it was discovered that the Beta Gate 1 leaderboard was separated from the next gates coming up (only showing the top 77 finishers).
