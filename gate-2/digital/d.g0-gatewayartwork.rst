The gate's background resembles the polka dots from Team Salvado's *(Doki Doki Literature Club)* that are shown on the start menu and in the text boxes throughout the game.
The gate proper also contains a shadow that resembles Toriel from UNDERTALE *(Toby Fox)*.

The hints hidden in the gateway appear to indicate that this gateway will be about indie games.
Indie games are games that usually do not have the financial support from publishers.

The flashing gate, interpreted as Morse code, states ``THEONETRUEGOD``.
